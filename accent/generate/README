This directory, `$DISTRIBUTION/generate',
contains the original sources of the Accent Compiler Compiler.
They are used to generate the C code which is
distributed in directory `$DISTRIBUTION/accent'.

Because the C code of Accent is part of the distribution
you do not need to touch this directory.

If you want to regenerate the C code
adapt and execute the script `build'
in this directory.

This requires the Gentle Compiler Construction System.
It can be downloaded from http://gentle.compilertools.net .
